## 🔧 Today I Worked On  
Authenticating a basic web3 app using `wagmi`, `QueryClientProvider`, and `RainbowKit`.

## 🧱 Challenges  
- Understanding the new method of authentication  
- Less knowledge of Web3 terminologies and their interplay  
- The application is not working yet  

---

## 💡 Insights  
- The need to strengthen the domain knowledge  
- Focus should be more on understanding the fundamentals
